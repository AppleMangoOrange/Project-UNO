    Four 0s in all four colours [ZERO*4] (4)

At the start 7 cards are dealt to each player, and the player
to the left of the dealer plays first (unless action/wild card)

Player with 1 card remaining must call UNO!. If not caught or says UNO
before getting caught, no penalties apply. Can only be caught before
the next subsequent player plays their turn.

Wild Draw 4 can only be played if the player has no other cards of that
colour. If done anyway, only the next subsequent player can challenge.
If caught, penalty applies. If not caught, no penalty.
